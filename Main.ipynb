    "GitHub Copilot: This code implements a **Two-Echelon Vehicle Routing Problem (2E-VRP)** solution using Google OR-Tools. Here's what it does:\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "The system models a supply chain with two levels of distribution:\n",
    "- **Echelon 1**: Large trucks deliver from main warehouse (Lahore) to regional satellites\n",
    "- **Echelon 2**: Smaller trucks deliver from satellites to final sub-warehouses\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Components\n",
    "\n",
    "### Helper Functions\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def euclidean_km(p1, p2) -> int:\n",
    "    # Calculates straight-line distance between two coordinate points\n",
    "    \n",
    "def build_distance_matrix(points):\n",
    "    # Creates a square matrix of distances between all locations\n",
    "    \n",
    "def solve_vrp(distance_matrix, demands, vehicle_capacities):\n",
    "    # Uses OR-Tools to solve the Vehicle Routing Problem\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Structure\n",
    "- **Cities**: Main locations with (x,y) coordinates relative to Lahore at (0,0)\n",
    "- **Satellites**: Each has coordinates and sub-warehouses to serve\n",
    "- **Demands**: How much cargo each sub-warehouse needs (in tons)\n",
    "- **Vehicle Capacities**: Different truck sizes for each echelon\n",
    "\n",
    "### Two-Phase Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "**Phase 1 - Echelon 2 (Satellites → Sub-warehouses)**:\n",
    "- For each satellite city, solve a VRP to serve its sub-warehouses\n",
    "- Uses smaller 7-ton trucks\n",
    "- Calculates total demand each satellite needs to receive\n",
    "\n",
    "**Phase 2 - Echelon 1 (Lahore → Satellites)**:\n",
    "- Uses the demand totals from Phase 1\n",
    "- Solves VRP with larger 20-ton trucks from Lahore\n",
    "- Delivers exactly what each satellite needs\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Output\n",
    "The code will show:\n",
    "- Route plans for each vehicle\n",
    "- Total distances traveled\n",
    "- Load capacities utilized\n",
    "- How much cargo flows through each satellite\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach is common in real logistics where you have regional distribution centers that need to be supplied from a main warehouse, then distribute locally to final destinations.\n",
    "\n",
